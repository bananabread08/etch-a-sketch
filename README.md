# etch-a-sketch

An Etch-a-Sketch project as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project. This is to flex the materials we had learned in the DOM Manipulation Lesson and to Vanilla Javascript as a whole.

v.1: 16x16 grid. Can initially "sketch".  

v.2: Ability to resize grid. Limited to a value up to 100. Higher values can cause lag in browser.  

What I learned:  
1. The use of `setProperty` to manipulate CSS from the DOM.  
2. Got a bit comfortable in using event listeners.  
3. CSS Grid!!
